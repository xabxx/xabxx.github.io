                <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1">
                  <p>This <a href="https://xabxx.github.io/alexa-post.html">repo<a> contains the source code and the speech assets.
                  <p>In this post I will demonstrate how I created my first Amazon Alexa skill - The Future Us.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">The Future Us: Purpose, Features, Implementation</h2>
                  <p>Long story short: Synthetic biology is my concentration/class focus in my major.
                  A lot of people don't know what it is and I thought I would start a channel where people can get up-to-date synthetic biology feeds.
                  The purpose of the this skill is to attract more bright minds into the field.  Features include asking the definition of synthetic biology, getting synthetic biology feeds, and getting synthetic biology trivia.
                  Feeds and trivia are pulled from <a href="xabxx.github.io/alexa-synbio-updates.html">here</a>. I hand-pick news in the field and post them on this site, and the skill makes a request to the site each time the skill is called.
                  Why did I name it "The Future Us"? Once upon a time we could not conceive the notion of automation and machines until a group of people realized the inconceivable dreams. Here we are, breathing at a point in history,
                  wondering what will be the next big move that will change human race. To me, the answer is engineered life...and synthetic biology will likely make this a reality. âˆ´ Engineered life could be "The Future Us". </p>
                  <p>(People argue about the morality of engineering life, I will give my opinion regarding this controversial topic at the end of this post.)</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">AWS and Amazon Developer Console</h2>
                  <p>It's 4:20AM and I am too tired (and lazy) to walk through the set up process.
                  I will refer to other people's works on setting up the development environment - I used these sources for creating my own project.</p>
                  <p>Text guide: <a href="https://github.com/alexa">Official Amazon Alexa Github account<a>. Well-documented source, plus it's official.</p>
                  <p>Video guide: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt9WdE5kR6g">Decypher Media<a>. Well-explained and straight-forward (bonus if you like good-looking hard-core style kind of people).</p>
                  <p>I created a blank Lamda function on AWS and included the alexa-sdk module (along with two other modules).</p>
                  <p>In the hindsight, I think I would've benefited from reading the text guides more carefully and learning the basics of node.js, AND KNOWING THE CALLBACK HELL (really cool implementation though).</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">The Code</h2>
                  <p>The code is written in Javascript and has Node.js 6.10 runtime. Again I prefer not to go into details because the code pretty much explains itself (I guess for the most part).
                        The alexa SDK API calls are the same as in the Alexa sample projects from their official github account.
                  One thing that I want to highlight is the how I handled the asynchronous function - request. Below shows a snippet of the code that calls the asynchronous request.   </p>
                  <!-- <a href="img/a-code.JPG"><a> -->
                  <img class="img-responsive" src="img/a-code.jpg" alt="">
                  <span class="caption text-muted">Request call to the site where feeds and trivia are pulled from.</span>
                  <p>I included the call to registerHandlers and execute (line 87 and 88) in the callback function of the request call (line 72 - 89). This is ensure that there are at least one content in the arrays
                  where trivia and news are stored and randomly picked respectively. Without implementing the code this way, the code at line 72 will make the request GET call to scrape the contents
                  of the designated site, but it won't stop to wait for the call to finish - namely, the code will run pass line 72 and the arrays designed to store feeds and trivia will be empty. To prevent this from happening,
                  I included the last two lines to code (registerHandlers & execute) inside the callback function. Therefore, unless there is a connection error, the contents in the arrays should reflect contents on the site.</p>
                  <p>I packaged the index.js file, package.json file, and the node_modules folder into a .zip file, and I uploaded it onto the lambda function I created. Two other modules the code depends on are request and cheerio.</p>

                  <p>I was going to harshly end this post by not giving any indication that the last sentence was the end. Well I promised that I'd tell you if I think engineering life is an okay thing to do - YES I DO. </br>
                        Life makes improbable patterns that persist overtime. If these improbable patterns is contributing to addition of biological diversity, and if biological diversity is essential for us, as a species, to live, to thrive, and to evolve, then yessss!!   </br>
                        However, I vaguely remember my favorite professor in college once said (along the lines of) - we don't often see patterns in biology, and perhaps that suggests the fundamental components that we are made out of were never meant to be decoded. </br>
                        So yea, even super smart people are trying very hard, the extent to which we could engineer life could be limited. Plus we are far from being able to engineer human; ++ even if we can we probably won't live to see it.</br>
                        Sorry for the spoiler, I could be totally wrong, I mean, what do I know anyway :p </br>
                        (It's 5:16am and I am like super tired so forgive me if my argument is incomprehensible to you. And I regret so much writing this in the middle of the night ......)  </p>
